# Balance Sheet and Profit & Loss Statements Assignment

** Year: ** 2023

This was an assignment given in the Data Extraction and Visualization course during my Master in Finance.
The database is not publiquely accessible being in the Instructor's Online Server but this shows the code I created to do the assignment, the results can be seen in the pdf file.
The goal of the exercice was to build a balance sheet and profit and loss statements filtering and cleaning the data to show specific years and lines of the statements, adding metrics for analysis.

I made sure that the lines of code are explained to allow the reader to fully understand what was done and why.
